# Geometric Brownian Motion Simulation for Stock Price Projection

## Overview
This project simulates the geometric Brownian motion to project the price walk of a stock. It generates a graph showing the distribution of future prices, including both the open position price/date and the latest adjusted close price/date. This visualization helps compare the current price path with the one projected at the open position price/date.

Additionally, the simulation displays the final price distribution after N days of maturity and the expected gross margins for different percentiles of the final price.

## Features
- **Price Walk Projection**: Simulates the geometric Brownian motion to project future stock prices.
- **Graphical Visualization**: Generates a graph with the distribution of future prices, open position price/date, and latest adjusted close price/date.
- **Final Price Distribution**: Displays the distribution of final prices after N days.
- **Expected Gross Margins**: Calculates and displays the expected gross margins for different percentiles of the final price.

## Installation
To run this simulation, you need to have Python installed. You can install the required packages using:
